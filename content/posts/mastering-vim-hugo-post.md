Vim is a legendary text editor that has stood the test of time. Whether you're writing code, editing configuration files, or drafting a quick note, Vim provides a fast, efficient, and highly customizable editing experience — once you get past the learning curve.

## What is Vim?

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a modal text editor designed to be used entirely from the keyboard. It was created as an improvement over the `vi` editor found in early Unix systems, adding powerful features like multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, and scripting.

---

## Basic Usage

Here are some basic Vim commands to get you started:

### Opening and Closing

```bash
vim filename.txt     # Open a file
```

Once inside:

- `i` – Enter insert mode
- `Esc` – Return to normal mode
- `:w` – Save (write)
- `:q` – Quit
- `:wq` – Save and quit
- `:q!` – Force quit without saving

### Basic Movement

- `h` – left  
- `j` – down  
- `k` – up  
- `l` – right  
- `0` – beginning of the line  
- `^` – first non-blank character  
- `$` – end of the line  

### Editing Text

- `x` – delete character under cursor  
- `dd` – delete line  
- `yy` – yank (copy) line  
- `p` – paste below  
- `u` – undo  
- `Ctrl+r` – redo

## Intermediate Usage

### Searching and Replacing

```vim
/pattern        " search for pattern
n               " repeat search forward
N               " repeat search backward
:%s/foo/bar/g   " replace all 'foo' with 'bar'
```

### Copying and Pasting Between Files

Open multiple files with:

```bash
vim file1.txt file2.txt
```

Switch files:

- `:n` – Next file
- `:prev` – Previous file

Use registers to copy across:

- `"ayy` – yank line into register `a`
- `"ap` – paste from register `a`

---

## Advanced Usage

### Macros

Record and use macros for repetitive tasks:

```vim
qa      " start recording into register a
...     " do something
q       " stop recording
@a      " replay macro
@@      " replay last used macro
```

### Visual Block Mode

Use visual block mode to edit columns of text:

- `Ctrl+v` – start block selection
- `Shift+i` – insert before the block
- `Esc` – apply changes to all lines

### Split and Tab Management

```vim
:split filename.txt       " horizontal split
:vsplit filename.txt      " vertical split
:tabnew filename.txt      " new tab
gt                        " next tab
gT                        " previous tab
```

---

## Customization

Vim is highly customizable via the `.vimrc` configuration file.

### Example `.vimrc`

```vim
set number              " Show line numbers
syntax on               " Enable syntax highlighting
set tabstop=4           " Number of spaces per tab
set shiftwidth=4        " Indentation width
set expandtab           " Use spaces instead of tabs
set autoindent          " Maintain indent in new lines
set hlsearch            " Highlight search results
set incsearch           " Show search results while typing
set clipboard=unnamedplus " Use system clipboard
```

### Plugins (using vim-plug)

Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and add this to `.vimrc`:

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'         " File explorer
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'           " Fuzzy finder
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'         " Git integration
Plug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'      " Status line
call plug#end()
```

Install plugins:

```vim
:PlugInstall
```
