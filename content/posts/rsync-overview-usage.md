## Overview

`rsync` is a fast, reliable, and versatile file-copying tool commonly used on Unix-like systems. It efficiently transfers and synchronizes files between machines and directories by only copying the differences between source and destination. Whether you're backing up a home directory, syncing production servers, or replicating data across systems, `rsync` is a must-have utility in your toolbox.

---

## Why Use Rsync?

- Efficient: Only transfers changed blocks.
- Flexible: Works over SSH or directly between local directories.
- Powerful: Supports filters, compression, and bandwidth throttling.
- Reliable: Retains file permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, and ownership.

---

## Basic Usage

### Local File Sync

```bash
rsync -avh ~/Documents/ /mnt/backup/Documents/
```

- `-a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symbolic links, timestamps, etc.)
- `-v`: Verbose
- `-h`: Human-readable numbers (like KB, MB)

### Remote File Sync Over SSH

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh ~/Projects/ user@remote.server:/home/user/Projects/
```

- `-z`: Compress data during transfer
- `-e ssh`: Use SSH as the transport protocol

---

## Intermediate Examples

### Delete Files That No Longer Exist on the Source

```bash
rsync -av --delete ~/Media/ /mnt/media_backup/
```

> The `--delete` flag ensures that files deleted on the source are also deleted on the destination.

### Exclude Specific Files or Directories

```bash
rsync -av --exclude '*.mp4' --exclude 'node_modules/' ~/Projects/ /mnt/backup/
```

### Dry Run (Simulate Before Execution)

```bash
rsync -av --dry-run ~/Photos/ /mnt/photo_backup/
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Throttle Bandwidth Usage

```bash
rsync -avz --bwlimit=5000 ~/Videos/ remote:/data/backup/
```

> `--bwlimit=5000` limits the bandwidth to ~5MB/s

### Sync Using Rsync Daemon (for persistent services)

Set up `/etc/rsyncd.conf` on the server:

```ini
[files]
    path = /srv/rsync/files
    read only = no
    list = yes
```

Then use:

```bash
rsync -av rsync://remote.server/files /local/dir/
```

### Backup with Timestamped Directories

```bash
rsync -a ~/Documents/ "/mnt/backups/Documents-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/"
```

> Useful for daily backups with clear naming.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- ✅ Fast, only transfers deltas
- ✅ Preserves all file metadata
- ✅ Works over SSH securely
- ✅ Ideal for scripting and automation
- ✅ Highly configurable

### Cons

- ❌ Not ideal for syncing databases or locked files
- ❌ Can be complex for new users
- ❌ No built-in encryption at rest (use filesystem or SSH layer for that)
- ❌ Windows support is limited without WSL or Cygwin

---

## Conclusion

`rsync` remains one of the most powerful and efficient tools for syncing and backing up files. From simple directory copies to complex remote backups with bandwidth throttling and exclusion rules, `rsync` can handle it all. It's a staple for sysadmins, developers, and power users alike.
