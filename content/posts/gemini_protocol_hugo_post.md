## What is the Gemini Protocol?

The **Gemini protocol** is a lightweight, privacy-focused internet protocol designed to offer a middle ground between Gopher and HTTP. It emphasizes simplicity, minimalism, and user privacy. Gemini serves content in a plaintext markup format called **Gemtext**, intended to be viewed with specialized browsers called **Gemini clients**.

Created by [Solderpunk](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/), Gemini is not meant to replace the web, but to provide a smaller, calmer space for content consumption and expression.

## Getting Started with Gemini

### Step 1: Install a Gemini Client

Gemini requires a dedicated browser. Here are a few options:

- **Amfora (CLI-based)**  
  Written in Go, ideal for terminal users.  
  Install with:  
  ```bash
  go install github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora@latest
  ```
  Or download from: https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora

- **Lagrange (GUI-based)**  
  A modern, cross-platform Gemini browser.  
  Download: https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/

- **Kristall (Lightweight GUI)**  
  Supports Gemini, Gopher, and HTTP.

### Step 2: Explore the Geminispace

Gemini URLs use the `gemini://` scheme. Start with these directories and search engines:

- [gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/](gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
- [gemini://geminispace.info/](gemini://geminispace.info/)
- [gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/](gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/) (Feed aggregator)

Use your client to open these links or search terms and dive into the minimalist web.

### Step 3: Create Your Own Gemini Capsule

A Gemini "site" is called a **capsule**. To set one up:

#### Requirements

- A VPS or home server
- A Gemini server like `Agate`, `Molten`, or `Gemserv`
- TLS certificates (Gemini uses TLS by default)

#### Example with Agate:

1. **Install Agate**
   ```bash
   cargo install agate
   ```

2. **Generate TLS certs**
   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
   ```

3. **Start Agate**
   ```bash
   agate --content /var/gemini/content --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
   ```

4. **Write content in `.gmi` files**
   ```text
   # Welcome to my Gemini Capsule

   => gemini://geminispace.info Explore more
   ```

## Pros and Cons of Gemini

### ✅ Pros

- **Minimalist and distraction-free**: No JavaScript, no tracking, just content.
- **Privacy-focused**: No user-agent headers, cookies, or analytics by default.
- **Low bandwidth**: Perfect for slow or limited connections.
- **Easy to host**: Gemini servers are lightweight and simple to configure.
- **Strong community**: Engaged niche of writers, tinkerers, and thinkers.

### ❌ Cons

- **Limited media support**: No inline images, video, or audio (only links).
- **No interactivity**: Lacks support for forms or dynamic content.
- **Fragmented tools**: Still a niche project with fewer tools compared to HTTP.
- **TLS requirement**: Makes DIY hosting slightly more complex than Gopher.

## Final Thoughts

Gemini is a breath of fresh air for those who want a calm, minimal, and reader-focused internet. It's not a replacement for the web but a cozy alternative that encourages thoughtful publishing. Whether you're nostalgic for the early internet or just tired of bloated pages, Gemini might be your new favorite corner of the net.
